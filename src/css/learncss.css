/*We occasionally use media queries that go in the other direction (the given screen size or smaller)*/

/*Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)*/
@media (max-width: 575.98px) {}

/*Small devices (landscape phones, less than 768px)*/
@media (max-width: 767.98px) {}

/* Medium devices (tablets, less than 992px)*/
@media (max-width: 991.98px) {}

/* Large devices (desktops, less than 1200px)*/
@media (max-width: 1199.98px) {}

/*  Extra large devices (large desktops)
    No media query since the extra-large breakpoint has no upper bound on its width

    @include media-breakpoint-down(xs) { ... }
    @include media-breakpoint-down(sm) { ... }
    @include media-breakpoint-down(md) { ... }
    @include media-breakpoint-down(lg) { ... }
    // No media query necessary for xl breakpoint as it has no upper bound on its width

    // Example: Style from medium breakpoint and down
    @include media-breakpoint-down(md) {
        .custom-class {
             display: block;
        }
